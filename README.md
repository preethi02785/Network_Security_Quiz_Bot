# Network_Security_quiz_bot
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on building a Quiz bot based on the network security coursework. The bot is designed in a local environment to ensure data privacy is not compromised which helps us learn network work security skills. The quiz bot provides users with randomly generated questions and questions on specific topics we train the bot from a network security database which includes lecture slides, quizzes, homework, textbooks, and information over the internet. Further, it offers a diverse range of question formats which includes True or False, Multiple Choice, and open-ended questions. Based on the choice of user the quiz bot questions are displayed for the user to answer and it also has a feature to provide feedback to the user for the questions answered and also the source of the question which creates an informative learning experience.

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

## PREREQUISITES
* The recent Python version used is Python 3.12.0
* An API key for the GPT API from Openai.com
  
## REQUIREMENTS
* Python programming language
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for all kinds of projects.
* Google Colab text editor
* Open API key
An API key is a unique code that identifies your requests to the API. Your API key is intended to be used by you. The sharing of API keys is against the Terms of Use. As you begin experimenting, you may want to expand API access to your team.
* Installing required packages(open, difflib, PyPDF2):
  * OpenAI: You can install it using pip install OpenAI
  * difflib: It's part of the Python standard library, so no separate installation is required.
  * PyPDF2: Install it with pip install PyPDF2. 

## FEATURES
* Generates questions from a given text using the OpenAI language model.
* Conducts a quiz with multiple question types: MCQ, True/False, and Open-ended.
* Handles different question types gracefully.
* Randomly selects questions for a mixed quiz.
* Checks user answers and provides feedback.
