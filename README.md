# Network_Security_quiz_bot
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on building a Quiz bot based on the network security coursework. The bot is designed in a local environment to ensure data privacy is not compromised which helps us learn network work security skills. The quiz bot provides users with randomly generated questions and questions on specific topics we train the bot from a network security database which includes lecture slides, quizzes, homework, textbooks, and information over the internet. Further, it offers a diverse range of question formats which includes True or False, Multiple Choice, and open-ended questions. Based on the choice of user the quiz bot questions are displayed for the user to answer and it also has a feature to provide feedback to the user for the questions answered and also the source of the question which creates an informative learning experience.
